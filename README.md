# Shai-Hulud the Sandwormen

A simple surgical simulator data generator (application). Build to generate images for deep learning.

![Example generated surface](/images/WormSurface.png "Example surface")

![Example stone](/images/Stone.png "Example surface for stone structure")

Here an exmple rendering (using the viewer) that shows the tube geometry (smooth shading) with an addtional wireframe geometry (to see the quality of the mesh) and a stone geometry embedded into the wall.

We can now render a video sequence with a spotlight attached to the camera.
